  "description": "The gesture responder system manages the lifecycle of gestures in your app. A touch can go through several phases as the app determines what the user's intention is. For example, the app needs to determine if the touch is scrolling, sliding on a widget, or tapping. This can even change during the duration of a touch. There can also be multiple simultaneous touches.",
